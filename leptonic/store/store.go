// Package store provides a concurrency-safe lightweight storage solution with a simple interface.
// Embedders should call `Lock` and `defer Release` (or WithLock(func()error)) to wrap operations,
// or series of operations, to ensure secure use.
// Furthermore, a Store implementation must do atomic writes, providing guarantees that interrupted partial writes
// never get committed.
// The Store interface itself is meant to be generic, and alternative stores (memory based, or content-addressable)
// may be implemented that satisfies it.
// This package also provides the default, file based implementation that we are using.
package store

// ErrLockFailure may be returned by ReadLock, WriteLock, or Unlock, when the underlying locking mechanism fails.
// In the case of the filesystem implementation, inability to lock the directory will return it.
var ErrLockFailure = errors.New("lock failure")

// Store represents a store that is able to grant an exclusive lock (ensuring concurrency safety,
// both between go routines and across multiple binaries invocations), and is performing atomic operations.
// Note that Store allows manipulating nested objects:
// - Set([]byte("mykeyvalue"), "group", "subgroup", "my key1")
// - Set([]byte("mykeyvalue"), "group", "subgroup", "my key2")
// - Get("group", "subgroup", "my key1")
// - List("group", "subgroup")
// Note that both Delete and Exists can be applied indifferently to specific keys, or groups.
type Store interface {
	Locker
	Manager

// Manager describes operations that can be performed on the store
type Manager interface {
	// List will return a slice of all subgroups (eg: subdirectories), or keys (eg: files), under a specific group (eg:
	// dir)
	// Note that `key...` may be omitted, in which case, all objects' names at the root of the store are returned.
	// Example, in the volumestore, List() will return all existing volumes names
	List(key ...string) ([]string, error)
	// Exists checks that a given key exists
	// Example: Exists("meta.json")
	Exists(key ...string) (bool, error)
	// Get returns the content of a key
	Get(key ...string) ([]byte, error)
	// Set saves bytes to a key
	Set(data []byte, key ...string) error
	// Delete removes a key or a group
	Delete(key ...string) error
	// Location returns the absolute path to a certain resource
	// Note that this technically "leaks" (filesystem) implementation details up.
	// It is necessary though when we are going to pass these filepath to containerd for e.g.
	Location(key ...string) (string, error)

	// GroupSize will return the combined size of all objects stored under the group (eg: dir)
	GroupSize(key ...string) (int64, error)
	// GroupEnsure ensures that a given group (eg: directory) exists
