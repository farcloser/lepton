// Package store provides a concurrency-safe lightweight storage solution with a simple interface.
// Embedders should call `Lock` and `defer Unlock` (or WithLock(func()error)) to wrap operations,
// or series of operations, to ensure secure use.
// Furthermore, a Store implementation must do atomic writes, providing guarantees that interrupted partial writes
// never get committed.
// The Store interface itself is meant to be generic, and alternative stores (memory based, or content-addressable)
// may be implemented that satisfies it.
// This package also provides the default, file based implementation that we are using.

// - Set([]byte("mykeyvalue"), "group", "subgroup", "my key1")
// - Set([]byte("mykeyvalue"), "group", "subgroup", "my key2")
// - Get("group", "subgroup", "my key1")
// - List("group", "subgroup")
// Note that both Delete and Exists can be applied indifferently to specific keys, or groups.
